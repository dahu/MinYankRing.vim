A minimalistic reimplementation of YankRing.vim.

Design goals:
- Keep the code small and maintainable.
- Remap as few keys as possible to interfere with vim's default behaviour as
  little as possible.

Design:
- Restrict it to cycling through the register used for the paste and the
  numbered registers. That way, we don't have to create a mapping for each and
  every command that yanks but let vim handle it instead.

Script outline:
. nmap p and P to script commands.
. nmap <c-n>/<c-p> after a paste was made and nunmap them afterwards (problem:
  how to detect this "afterwards"?).
. Find the last pasted area (should be easy enough using `[ and `]).
. Write a replacement command for that area, making sure it doesn't screw up the
  numbered registers.
. Profit!
